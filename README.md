# DE-Azure_Data_Factory_Project_on_Covid19
This project gives me an overview of Azure Data Factory(ADF). It supports me in gaining skills in how to create data pipelines, Triggers, and data Flows, preparing for data analysis or Machine Learning models.

## Project Objectives:
- Creating the data pipelines from source to sink (in the data factory)
- Creating the data Flow for transformation data
- Using DataBricks workspace for the transformation of data
- Build real-world data pipelines in Azure Data Factory (ADF).
- Master Data Engineering with ADF, Azure Data Lake Gen2, SQL Database, and Azure Monitor.
- Ingest data from HTTP, Azure Blob Storage into Azure Data Lake Gen2.
- Transform data using Data Flows, Databricks, and HDInsight in ADF.
- Load processed data into Azure SQL Database using ADF.
- Automate & schedule pipelines with ADF Triggers.
- Monitor & troubleshoot pipelines using Azure Monitor & Log Analytics.
- Follow best practices for production-ready pipelines and naming standards.
- Prepare for DP-203 certification with essential ADF topics.
- Implement CI/CD pipelines in Azure DevOps for ADF deployments.
